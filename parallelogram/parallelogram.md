# Properties of parallelogram
* Two pairs of opposite sides are parallel (by definition);
* Two pairs of opposite sides are equal in length;
* Two pairs of opposite angles are equal in measure;
* The diagonals bisect each other;
* Adjacent angles are supplementary<sup>1</sup>;
* Each diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two congruent triangles;
* The sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals. (This is the parallelogram law).

## Features of the class
The class will store the value of all angles (in degrees for simple description) and sides (in conventional units of length, including diagonals). Each value is optional so that a user can construct a parallelogram from the missing data and find out the missing data if it's possible.

## Author's notes
1) Their sum is 180<sup>o</sup>.
